<!-- Make a loop that counts from 5 to 15 in the Console, in multiples of 3. 
    You can have this print below the loop in #2 
above, or comment out the #2 code when you run this part.

//Make a loop that counts by two, from 40 to 60. Alert the result, adding line breaks between lines (add the string "\n"
in between each value).

//Make a loop that counts backwards from 100 to 0, and prints out in the Console.
//Push the file(s) with all the above code to GitHub, set up GitHub Pages, and submit the URL below.-->
